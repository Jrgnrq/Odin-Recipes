        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry tortillas and onion in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, stirring frequently. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Drain the skillet, leaving only a thin residue of oil. </li>
